Military history – humanities discipline within the scope of general historical recording of armed conflict in the history of humanity, and its impact on the societies, their cultures, economies and changing intra and international relationships.
Military engineering – the art and practice of designing and building military works and maintaining lines of military transport and communications.
Military Strategy and Tactics – set of ideas implemented by military organizations to pursue desired strategic goals
Applied physics – physics intended for a particular technological or practical use. It is usually considered as a bridge between "pure" physics and engineering.
Optics – branch of physics which involves the behavior and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it.
Nanotechnology (outline) – study of manipulating matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally, nanotechnology deals with developing materials, devices, or other structures possessing at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometres. Quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale.
Nuclear technology (outline) – technology that involves the reactions of atomic nuclei. Among the notable nuclear technologies are nuclear power, nuclear medicine, and nuclear weapons. It has found applications from smoke detectors to nuclear reactors, and from gun sights to nuclear weapons.
Space Science – discipline encompassing the fields of study that involve space exploration and the study of natural phenomena occurring in outer space.
Astronautics – science of spacefaring and spaceflight.
Astronomy – the study of natural objects and phenomena.
Space Exploration – the discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by developing space technology.
Spatial science – academic discipline incorporating fields such as surveying, geographic information systems, hydrography and cartography. Spatial science is typically concerned with the measurement, management, analysis and display of spatial information describing the Earth, its physical features and the built environment.
GIS – geographic information system is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of geographical data.
Remote sensing – acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon, without making physical contact with the object.
Photogrammetry – practice of determining the geometric properties of objects from photographic images.
