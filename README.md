# ScientificSubfieldCollider
Combines two randomly selected scientific (broad sense) subfields together.

Subfield_Collider.py contains the function.  Call it with collider(), then answer the number of collisions with an integer.  

File ScientificDisciplines.txt is used in the function, so the path object needs to be changed to the location you put it on your computer.  

ScienceDisciplinesReferences.txt lists the sources that the raw text in ScientificDisciplines.txt was copied from.
